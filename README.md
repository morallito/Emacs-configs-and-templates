# Iago's Emacs repo 


This repo stores my Emacs configuration files and my org templates.



## Meeting records

Record meetings is important. Keep track of what was decided and all the useful info's in a meeting is something difficult. This template provides a simple way to resume a meeting and generate an HTML file from that, using org mode.


## presentation template


writing in latex is tedious, because although it is a very useful language, it is very verbose. Org mode is an option for those who like me want to enjoy the power of Latex without having to waste time learning all that syntax. This template basically contains all the resources you may need to make a quality presentation in the academic or professional environment.


## configuration

Emacs brings many cool tools that can help you increase the quality of your work and your productivity. However, memorizing all those functions in Lisp that you use to configure your environment is not an easy task. This folder contains all the settings I use on my Emacs.

I call it morallito's licensing.
